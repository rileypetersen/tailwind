# Tailwind component library (WIP)

This repo is evolving into a **plug-and-play React component library** authored with Tailwind CSS and documented in Storybook.

## Goals

- Publish **compiled CSS** so consumers do **not** need Tailwind configured
- Allow **simple overrides** via CSS variables (theme tokens)
- Keep everything verifiable via Storybook + CI
